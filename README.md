Dinosaur Facts is a website designed mainly for children 7 years and up. Its main purpose is to provide a fun environment in which the children can test out their knowledge for their beloved Dinosaurs. 


## UX
I aimed to create a simple quiz game for children that looks fun, but is very easy on the eye with design.

#### The ideal client:
* Children
* Dinosaur Lovers
* English Speaking

### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website
* Test their knowledge

## Owner Stories
1. As the owner, I want the game to be fun and make the user to keep playing.
2. As the owner, I want the game to be educational.
3. As the owner, I want to show my new learned skills with JavaScript.

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate the site to start the game.
2. As a visitor, I want to be able to play the game and see how many questions I got right or wrong.

### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:

1. A game container where all the buttons, Heading, questions and score will be nested.
2. Fully functioning Buttons to navigate, and control the game.
3. Score area where right and wrong answers will be added up.

### The skeleton
The Game consists of only 1 page index.html which is the main page. I am using JavaScript to make buttons and divs hide and reappear to give the illusion of different game areas.

* Responsive on all device sizes.
* Heading introduction to the game.
* question and answer display.
* Pointer effect with Hover: when hovering over answers and buttons.
* Start button on main page.
* Score pannel

### Future features
I ran out of time to implement these changes, I will inplment them in the future:
* Form validation: The input required in the "name" box.
* Save score option.
* Top 5 high scores board.

## The Design
To achieve my goal, I included the following features in my website:

The Quiz has 3 areas:
1. Home Page which displays the heading and a start button.
2. quiz page after hitting the Start button, a list of questions and avaialable answers with a score pannel apears. 
3. End page is where the question container disapears and only displays the score panel and Restart and Home buttons.
