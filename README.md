Dinosaur Facts is a website designed mainly for children 7 years and up. Its main purpose is to provide a fun environment in which the children can test out their knowledge for their beloved Dinosaurs. 

## UX
I aimed to create a simple quiz game for children that looks fun, but is very easy on the eye with design.

#### The ideal client:
* Children
* Dinosaur Lovers
* English Speaking

### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website
* Test their knowledge

## Owner Stories
1. As the owner, I want the game to be fun and make the user to keep playing.
2. As the owner, I want the game to be educational.
3. As the owner, I want to show my new learned skills with JavaScript.

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate the site to start the game.
2. As a visitor, I want to be able to play the game and see how many questions I got right or wrong.

### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:

1. A game container where all the buttons, Heading, questions and score will be nested.
2. Fully functioning Buttons to navigate, and control the game.
3. Score area where right and wrong answers will be added up.

### The skeleton
The Game consists of only 1 page index.html which is the main page. I am using JavaScript to make buttons and divs hide and reappear to give the illusion of different game areas.

* [Web view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/dinosaur-quiz/blob/master/readme-images/wireframes/web-view.png)

* [Tablet view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/dinosaur-quiz/blob/master/readme-images/wireframes/tablet-view.png)

* [Phone view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/dinosaur-quiz/blob/master/readme-images/wireframes/phone-view.png)

## Features
* Responsive on all device sizes.
* Heading introduction to the game.
* question and answer display.
* Pointer effect with Hover: when hovering over answers and buttons.
* Start button on main page.
* Score pannel
* Restart and Home Buttons

### Future features
I ran out of time to implement these changes, I will inplement them in the future:
* Form validation: The input required in the "name" box.
* Save score option.
* Top 5 high scores board.

## The Design
It is a children's game therefore the imagery is very simple. I added a wallpapper background with a selection of Dinosaurs which I got from google images. once the game is restarted, I left the Home button underneath the score panel so that the child can return back to the main page if wanted. 

The Quiz has 3 areas:
1. Home Page which displays the heading and a start button.
2. quiz page after hitting the Start button, a list of questions and avaialable answers with a score pannel apears. These questions are shuffled  so that they arent shown in the same order each time.
3. End page in which is where the questions are hiden and only displays the score panel, Restart and Home buttons.

## Technologies Used
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces)I used this developer to write the code for this website.
* [Github](https://github.com/) Was used to host my code that was created and pushed to Gitpod.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) Was used to style the website's fonts.
* [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)I used this website to compress my images to improve website loading times.
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) Was use to check the markup of the web documents in HTLM.
* [W3C jigsaw Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) Was used to chech and validate the CSS in my project.
* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)Was used to inspect any javascript issues and inspect the responsiveness of the website.

 ### Adicional Testing
 I used dev tools to continuesly inspect my code and check my responsivnes in diferent screen sizes.
 I also  W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services as well as jshint to ensure there were no errors in the project.
* W3C HTML Validation
* W3C CSS Validator
* Jshint

### Content
Questions,and image and quiz ideas have been taken from:

## Credits
* Pieces from my code and main quiz idea has come from this youtube video. 
[Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k)
* I also used [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/build-interactive-websites/projects/chore-door) to help me expand my knowledge of javascript so that I was able to write my own functions. Building the chorebot game has greatly improved my understanding based on how it was broken down and explained. prior to this I was feeling very lost and didnt understand javascript at all. 
* Getting to this stage I can say that I am at the very begining of understanding javascript and I love the potential this language has. Some inspiration has also been taken from the following video: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY)
* My Mentor Guido Cecilio Garcia Bernal was extremely helpful in breaking all the steps down for me and answering any questions I had.
